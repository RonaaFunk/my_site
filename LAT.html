				<p>I have been tasked with showing how I would go about creating textures for the interior of a Aston
Martin DB5 for an upcoming James Bond movie. I’ll be breaking this down into the 3 steps taken
being;
1. Studying reference images to accurately ascertain what materials would appropriate to
recreate.
2. Researching those materials further to better understand the components that make up the
texture.
3. Talking through the processes used within Substance Designer, including the graphs and
nodes, that would result in a universal texture that can be applied to an image or 3D model of
the DB5 in question. </p>
				<h3 style="text-decoration: underline">Task 3</h3>
				<p>In this section I will study the 2D greyscale image provided and break it down into the different
parts and speak to the materials commonly used in manufacturing process.
1. The interior walls of the DB5 seem in almost every case to be upholstered in extremely high
quality leather. This level of high quality is constant throughout the entire manufacturing
process as these are prestige cars and each component reflects that. The leathers used vary
somewhat in colour seeming to include black, beige, a duck egg blue and some others. In the
case of the leather used for the doors being black it is generally consistent with the floor
carpet colour but in the cases where other colours are used, most of them opt for a two tone
leather to carpet colour pallet.
2. The materials used for the seats are usually made from the same material that the doors are
from. Generally being again a very high quality leather.

3. This middle area, presumably storage or some form
of arm rest is a bit harder to determine. This is
because it seems to be an optional extra that varies
from car to car and as such could be a variety of
different things. In seems however that the most
common thing it would be, in terms of a car fitting
for 007, is an arm rest that conceals various controls
for the non stock features of the car. If this is in fact
what we determine it to be then it is most likely to
made from the the same leather used for the doors
and seats.
4. As seen in the above images the leather base for the
gear stick is constant with whatever leather is used
throughout the rest of the car. The use of only one
colour of leather seems to be a very common them
in almost every image of a DB5 interior I could find. It
is worth noting however that this is in the case of a
manual transmission variation of the car. Whilst
automatics can still have this feature, I have seen
some that slide through a metal channel as soon in
the across image.
5. The door handles are where we get into our first non leather component. These are across all
my reference images made of a very highly polished metal. Whilst many metals can be
polished to this standard is would seem that in these cases, chrome ,or a chrome plating at
least, would be used.
6. The hatch door component of the glove box seems again to be using the leather common to
the car.
7. The dashboard and area encasing the dials, glove box and continuing on around the top of
the doors was a lot harder to determine. A lot of the reference images make it seem like either
a gloss finished metal or a form of plastic. After a bit more research into the year the DB5 was
released, 1963, It seems like plastics wear in fact commercially viable and outweighed the
production of non-ferrous metals so I believe a high quality plastic would be the material of
choice.
8. This panelled area is an area for optional extras again so to
determine what should go there is a matter of context and with
this being a car for 007, it is most likely a gadget of some form or
another. The most common gadget i’ve scene placed here,
although in a slightly different arrangement, is some form of
navigation system as shown in the image to the side.
9. The dials across the dashboard are pretty consistent in all
models. Across the whole front facing piece there are usually;
one for fuel, RPM, oil, water, AMPs and temperature. Along with
a clock in the centre. These dials would have use a combination
of plastic faces and needles, chrome or chrome plated trims and
a small circular piece of glass mounted in front to keep them all
protected.
10. As stated earlier the colour of carpet will vary depending what
leather is used but it only seem to change between black and beige from what I’ve seen. In
the Greyscale image given it doesn’t seem to have and floor mats either which can be
common in some DB5 models. This would lead to the carpet being a thicker more durable
material so as to not wear through. This however is not always the most attractive looking
carpet so a compromise between prestige and durability will be required.
11. The ring of the steering wheels of the DB5 are primarily made from a multiple layers of wood
framing a hardwood ply of sorts. This is then most likely varnished or stained and then
lacquered to give it an extremely high quality look and feel. The is a similar process use in
super yachts. The exact types of wood used seem to be varied and a choice made for each
car but the most likely candidates would be either a European Oak or Ash, both darkened with
a stain. Dotted around the entire circle are small metallic pins. These pins are flush with the
front face of the wheel but protrude out of the back to act as grip for the driver instead of the
otherwise smooth wheel. This would most likely be police aluminium. 
12. I have found that the centre stem of the steering wheel is
often referred to as a hollowed aluminium shaft, often
painted black. this also where an Aston Martin or custom
Logo are mounted as a horn button. This horn button is in
most case a variant of blue in colour.
13. The classic 3 spoke steering wheel is a staple of the DB5.
These spokes have their variants in texture but the material
commonly used is again aluminium or a lightweight variation
of it.
14. The radio used in the DB5 is fairly standard and is
compromised of black plastic chrome trim and a little bit of
glass.
15. The two switch type mounted objects on either side of the
clock seem to be made from a highly polished metal, most
likely chrome.
16. The head of the gear stick is most likely another object with possible variations but most seem
to comprised of more leather that is either embossed or has some other mounted face with
the gears clearly labelled.
17. The lock on the glove box is another highly polished metal component. this time more likely to
be a less malleable metal than chrome or aluminium, a form of steel most probably but with a
chrome trim surrounding it.</p>
