				<h1> LDF Ass2 - Aaron Hawke (s5225514) </h1>
				<h2>Genre/Mode</h2>
				<p> The level that I have designed for this assessment is a throwback to the survival horror
	games of the late 90s and early 00s. I have decided to make a level in this way to
	maximise the horror elements and to create a higher level of cinematic storytelling. The
	game will be single player and story driven by Lovecraftian inspired enemies and themes.
	I will achieve this homage/mimicry style by incorporating fixed camera angles and very
	basic movement controls (tank controls). These will help bring about the horror I wish to
	achieve by limiting, in terms of the camera angles, what is visible and more importantly
	what isn’t leading to sense of dread that is in keeping with the Lovecraftian themes, a fear
	of the unknown. The choice to limit the ability to control the protagonist effectively is also
	an attempt to remove as much confidence from the player as possible and when coupled
	with the camera angles, the two separate decisions feed into one another to create a
	solid base level of fear/anxiety which can be built on with other elements throughout the
	rest of the level.</p>
				<p>This section or chapter of the game will be somewhere in the middle and see the
	protagonist arrive in a near deserted island harbour village with the intention of procuring
	a boat to make it back to the mainland. Circumstances leading to this section will leave
	the protagonist empty handed and force them to arm themselves with fresh gear and
	gather essential items from various locations around the village. The village Itself will have
	one road heading into it which is how our protagonist arrived. unfortunate for the player,
	they arrive in a car which they swiftly crash whilst avoiding a monster. This has them
	thrown from the car and onto the road. Once awakening they realise the car is now on fire
	and along with the parked car it hit is blocking the road back out.</p>
				<p>Not only will this serve as an interesting cutscene but it will also provide a way of limiting
	the map without the need for any invisible walls. This will be the first light source of the
	level as well with the possibility to add in some visually pleasing particle effects. This will
	be a common theme throughout the level as with it being set in a near deserted village
	there are very few light sources still working. The main light source being the moonlight
	which will be exaggerated but not enough to lose atmosphere. The rest of the light
	sources will mainly be things on fire and will mostly be set below the head height of the
	character to achieve a spookier atmosphere again and many towering shadows.
	While combat will not be a main focus of this level or indeed the game as a whole, it will
	have its part to play. The potential for weaponry however will be basic, beginning with a
	simple iron bar found in the road as you start. The only other weapons that will be
	findable will be a fire axe found in a hardware store and a slow firing harpoon gun on one
	of the boats in the dock.</p>
